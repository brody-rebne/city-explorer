# City Explorer

**Author**: Brody Rebne
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

City Explorer is a search tool which will display relevant information for a city. If you are planning a trip and want to know things to do in the area while you're there, or if you want to know your local weather for the upcoming week, City Explorer can tell you everything you need to know.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

City Explorer is run on a Node.js backend, which is run on Express and deployed through Heroku. It uses Superuser to query external APIs and Cors to enforce access rules.

## Change Log

**Feb 18 2020** - App is fully set up and queries dummy data to return information on location and weather.

**Feb 19 2020** - App uses APIs to return live information for location, weather, and trails.
